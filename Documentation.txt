There are three credit scores that banks and credit card companies use to label their customers:

~Good
~Standard
~Poor

A person with a good credit score will get loans from any bank and financial institution.
For the task of Credit Score Classification, we need a labelled dataset with credit scores.

One can use or download the dataset https://statso.io/credit-score-classification-case-study/.
